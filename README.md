Ion Engine model
================

Physics-based formulation of and Ion Engine working principles to assess performance. The key figures 
of merits include thrust, specific impulse, power consumption, and system mass, where the latter
requires a detailed sub systems decomposition rather than simplified specific mass coefficients.
Ultimately, this tool will be used to perform trade studies and optimization analysis among other 
Propulsion Systems alternatives for Lunar and Martian endeavors, where missions impose higher power supply
requirements.
